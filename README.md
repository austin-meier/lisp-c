# LISP-C
### WIP

This is a LISP implementation written in pure C. I began this project in an attempt to develop a deeper understanding of LISP and the workings of programming languages in general. I believe a LISP implementation is the easiest first step.

I am still learning C, one area I am largely lacking in is tooling (although I get the feeling all C/C++ developers are). Therefore, this project does not use a build system at the moment. I am simply building from source with GCC.
```
gcc main.c data.c lexer.c parser.c printer.c eval.c -o lisp
```
